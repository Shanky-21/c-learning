An array is a collections of items of similar data type.
its just like any other variable.but, it stores several items of same data type.
for e.g. 
const int A[]={12,13,14,15};		// its an const array of size 4 of type integer
const array means that its value can't be changed.
array are very helpful to store data in a single variable and we can easily traverse any of them by their indexings.
like other languages, indexing in array also starts from 0. Means index of last elements is (size-1).
