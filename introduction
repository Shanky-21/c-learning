c language was created by dannis ritchie in 1972 at A & T's bell in U.S.A.
Today when many languages appear and vanish daily in the technological market, C has survived over three decades.
for being in the market for so many years one has to be very strong and flexible.when Ritchie made this language,
he doesn't did any promotions and advertisments for it, still many programers were moving towards C instead of fortan,algol etc.
  Today, many people have opinion that other strong languages like C++,C#, java etc, have passed over C.
as they basically work on the basis of OOPs(object oriented programming) so they have some advantages as well as disadvantages
C.
These are somepoints that why we still need c.
